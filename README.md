# Mix Documentation
Mix works by loading the Assemblies of mods and instantiating a subclass of `Mix.Mod` defined in the mod's assembly. Non-script assets in Unity can be exported via AssetBundles.

## Pre-requisites
1. Install Unity 6000.0.23f1 from https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive

1. Clone this example Unity project.
1. Open the project with Unity 6000.0.23f1.

1. Generate AssetBundles and Assemblies for the Third Person Controller Starter Playground.
	1. Be sure to add Unity Input System to the assembly definition's references.
1. Open the `items` folder at `LocalLow/Team Mix/Mix/items` via the folder button on the left sidebar in Mix. 
1. Subscribe to and copy one of the sample mods in the Steam Workshop to the `items` folder. Use this as a template for your mod.
1. Copy the generated AssetBundles and Assemblies to your mod's folder.
	1. The Playground assembly also needs `Cinemachine.dll`
1. Configure `item.json` and `mod.json` to match your mod.
1. You're done! Mix should detect your mod and you should be able add it to your modpacks.
