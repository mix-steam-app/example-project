### Why Early Access?

Mix is launching in Early Access to give creators the chance to experiment and build unique gameplay experiences. By releasing in Early Access, we want to gather valuable community feedback, refine modding tools, and test the platform’s capabilities. This phase allows us to evolve Mix alongside its users, ensuring that it meets the needs of both creators and players.

### How long will Mix be in Early Access?

We expect Mix to be in Early Access for about 12 to 18 months. During this time, we’ll continue to develop and enhance the platform, adding new features and refining existing tools based on community feedback. Our focus will be on making Mix a fully-featured, powerful modding platform that empowers creators and provides great experiences for players.

### What will the full version be like compared to Early Access?

The full version of Mix will be significantly expanded, allowing users to combine thousands of modules into one cohesive experience. This will open up greater creative possibilities, enabling creators to develop complex systems and richer gameplay environments by seamlessly integrating a wide variety of user-generated content. 

### What is the current state of the Early Access version?

Right now, Mix is in an early stage as a mod manager that allows for basic testing and combining of modules within a Unity scene. It includes a few example modules, such as the Unity Third Person Playground, to demonstrate how modules interact. The platform is playable, but it’s still evolving, so there may be bugs, missing features, and limited modding capabilities at this stage.

### Will the price change during or after Early Access?

There may be minor adjustments to the price over time to account for inflation and the ongoing development of the platform, but Mix will remain affordable throughout Early Access and beyond. We aim to ensure that the platform is accessible to as many creators and players as possible, growing the community and expanding the reach of Mix’s tools.

### How will the community be involved in the development process?

Community involvement is key to the development of Mix. We encourage players and creators to share feedback through the Steam Community forums and participate in discussions about future features. User input will be central in shaping the direction of the platform, allowing us to continuously improve and tailor Mix to meet the needs of its community.
